      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been implementing gen AI solutions for clients for a while now. Mostly this has been LLM based features for different kinds of SaaS software and I have not yet come across a reason to fine-tune models. On the other hand, talking to technical people in meetups, I have noticed that some people seem to really think that fine-tuning is important. I suspect this has something to do with engineers with an ML background wanting to justify training models, even though it may not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
